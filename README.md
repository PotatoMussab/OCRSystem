# Description  
This is the program used in my Bachelor's thesis. The intent is to make an OCR System for practical use in an office environment. Other software can then be
used with the system to be able to perform tedious or repetitive tasks on handwritten documents. Consequently, accuracy is a higher priority than speed since
a tedious task done automatically still reduces the burden of employees.

# Disclaimer
The program is incomplete and when compiled, will not do anything. Classes for the preprocessing and segmentation have been complete. However, a mechanism
to differentiate between text and non-text has not yet been implemented. The character recognition part has also not been yet implemented due to Java's
bad compatibility with SVM problems.
